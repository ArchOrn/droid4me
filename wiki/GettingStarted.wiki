= Introduction =

In order to integrate the framework to your Android application, you need to download its .jar file, copy it into your Android project "libs" directory, and add it to the classpath.

If you do not have access to the source code, please refer to [http://shared.smartnsoft.com/droid4me/api/ the JavaDoc API documentation].
