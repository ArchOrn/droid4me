# Welcome to the droid4me project #

droid4me is a framework library dedicated to the development of Android applications.

# What is droid4me? #
droid4me addresses the following topics:

  * [Activity/Fragment life cycle](https://github.com/smartnsoft/droid4me/wiki/LifeCycle): it attempts to turn the `Activity`/`Fragment` life cycle from something technical to something functional
  * [Centralized exception handling](https://github.com/smartnsoft/droid4me/wiki/ExceptionHandler): whenever an exception is thrown during the application, it can be handled in a centralized and secure way
  * [Activity redirection](https://github.com/smartnsoft/droid4me/wiki/ActivityController): if an Activity should always be displayed before another one, you have control over it
  * [Activity/Fragment events interception](https://github.com/smartnsoft/droid4me/wiki/ActivityController): handle in one place most of the entities life cycle events through a dedicated `Interceptor`
  * [Application helper](https://github.com/smartnsoft/droid4me/wiki/SmartApplication): eases the framework integration to your application
  * [Logging](https://github.com/smartnsoft/droid4me/wiki/LoggerFactory): proposes something similar to log4j/java.util.logging with logging level trigger and condition logging. Logging is still effective outside of Android environment
  * [Bitmap downloading](https://github.com/smartnsoft/droid4me/wiki/BitmapDownloader): it provides a fully fledge component which makes bitmap downloading and binding to Views very simple, effective, and easy to be supported with persistence
  * Caching and [persistence](https://github.com/smartnsoft/droid4me/wiki/Persistence): proposes a finely tunable mechanism which lets cache business objects in memory and persistently, hence promoting disconnected working applications
  * TokenKeeper: makes easy to remember tokens and broadcast them, for better communication between `Activity`/`Fragment` and complex caching policies
  * Web service wrapping: makes the integration of web services very productive, while enabling persistence and caching
  * [Threading](https://github.com/smartnsoft/droid4me/wiki/SmartCommands): makes possible the loading of an activity in an asynchronous way in a glimpse. Proposes two optimized thread pools
  * Menus: makes the definition of menus and contextual menus very straightforward
