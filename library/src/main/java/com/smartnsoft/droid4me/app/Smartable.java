/**
 * All {@link Activity activities} and {@link Fragment fragments} entities of the framework must at least implement this composite interface.

 * Any entity implementing this interface is considered as droid4me-ready (or droid4me-compliant) and benefit from all the framework features.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * If the implementing entity also implements the {@link AppPublics.BroadcastListener}, or the {@link AppPublics.BroadcastListenerProvider} or the
 * {@link AppPublics.BroadcastListenersProvider} interface, the framework will register one or several {@link BroadcastReceiver broadcast receivers},
